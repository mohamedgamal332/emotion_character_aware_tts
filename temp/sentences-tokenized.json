        "shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures. yet what depths of the soul does jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish’s belly! how billow-like and boisterously grand! we feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! but _what_ is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches? shipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god. as sinful men, it is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah. as with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of god—never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed—which he found a hard command. but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. and if we obey god, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying god consists."

        "such a queer dream, king-post, i never had. you know the old man’s ivory leg, well i dreamed he kicked me with it; and when i tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, i kicked my leg right off! and then, presto! ahab seemed a pyramid, and i, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. but what was still more curious, flask—you know how curious all dreams are—through all this rage that i was in, i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from ahab. ‘why,’ thinks i, ‘what’s the row? it’s not a real leg, only a false leg.’ and there’s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump. that’s what makes a blow from the hand, flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. the living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. and thinks i to myself all the while, mind, while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, i say, i was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. yes,’ thinks i, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. besides,’ thinks i, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. but this insult is whittled down to a point only.’ but now comes the greatest joke of the dream, flask. while i was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. ‘what are you ’bout?’ says he. slid! man, but i was frightened. such a phiz! but, somehow, next moment i was over the fright. ‘what am i about?’ says i at last. ‘and what business is that of yours, i should like to know, mr. humpback? do _you_ want a kick?’ by the lord, flask, i had no sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, i saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. says i, on second thoughts, ‘i guess i won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘wise stubb,’ said he, ‘wise stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise stubb, wise stubb,’ i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. but i had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘stop that kicking!’ ‘halloa,’ says i, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. captain ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘yes, he did,’ says i—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘yes, he did,’ says i. ‘well then,’ says he, ‘wise stubb, what have you to complain of? didn’t he kick with right good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? no, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, stubb. it’s an honor; i consider it an honor. listen, wise stubb. in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, stubb, that ye were kicked by old ahab, and made a wise man of. remember what i say; _be_ kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t help yourself, wise stubb. don’t you see that pyramid?’ with that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. i snored; rolled over; and there i was in my hammock! now, what do you think of that dream, flask?"

        "on the eastern shore of our lake erie, don; but—i crave your courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla; this lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our america, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean. for in their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—erie, and ontario, and huron, and superior, and michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east, dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland, as well as winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the state, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. and for radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. yet was this nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. at all events, he had proved so thus far; but radney was doomed and made mad, and steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear."

        "it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the town-ho’s leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious."
